## Class ```MinorMusicGenerator```:
-- Contains all notes and chords that should be used (calculated for the given scale).
-- ```.correct_notes``` and ```minor_chords``` sound good together.

## GeneratorXX.py:
-- Examples of music generators.
-- They use different tempos, baselines, patterns, etc.
